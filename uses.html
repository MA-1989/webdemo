    The Akhal-Teke, due to its natural athleticism, can be a sport horse, good at
    dressage, show jumping, eventing, racing, and endurance riding. A noted example
    was the Akhal-Teke stallion, Absent, who won the Grand Prix de Dressage at the
    1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, while being ridden by Sergei Filatov. He went again
    with Filatov to win the bronze individual medal in Tokyo in the 1964 Summer
    Olympics, and won the Soviet team gold medal under Ivan Kalita at the 1968 Summer
    Olympics in Mexico City. However, by today's studbook standards he wouldn't be
    admitted as Akhal-Teke, owing to the Thoroughbred ancestry of his dam Bakkara.
