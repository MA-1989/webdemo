  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>
    The ancestors of the breed may date back to animals living 3,000 years ago,
    known by a number of names, but most often as the Nisean horse. The precise
    ancestry is difficult to trace, however, because prior to about 1600 AD, horse
    breeds in the modern sense did not exist; rather, horses were identified by
    local strain or type.
  </p>
  <p>
    The breed is very similar to, and possibly the direct descendant of the Turkoman
    horse, a breed believed to be extinct, though a related strain may be bred today
    in Iran. Other breeds or strains with Turkoman roots also include the Yomud,
    Goklan and the Nokhorli. Some historians believe that the two are different
    strains of the same breed. It is a disputed "chicken or egg" question whether
    the influential Arabian was either the ancestor of the breed or was developed
    out of this breed. But a substantial number of Arabian mares have reportedly
    been used to improve the breed in the 14th and 19th century. It is also possible
    that the so-called "hot blooded" breeds, the Arabian, Turkoman, Akhal-Teke, and
    the Barb all developed from a single "oriental horse" predecessor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tribal people in what today is Turkmenistan first used the Akhal-Teke for raiding.
    The horses were their most treasured possession since they were crucial for income
    and survival. They selectively bred their horses, keeping records of the pedigrees
    via an oral tradition. Horses were managed and trained in very specific ways.
    Stallions were tethered next to the tent while mares and foals were free to seek
    forage. The stallions were covered from head to tail with up to seven layers of
    felt, which kept their coat short and shiny. Before raids they were put on a
    sparse diet to prepare them for the long ride through the desert with no water
    and hardly any feed. The horses were called Argamaks (divine or Sacred Horses)
    by the Russians, and were cherished by those who valued their speed and stamina
    in the desert and loyalty to their owner. Han emperors from China sacrificed
    armies to obtain just a few of the precious "Argamaks".

    In 1881, Turkmenistan became part of the Russian Empire. The tribes fought with
    the tsar, eventually losing. In the process, however, the Russian general
    Kuropatkin developed a fondness for horses he had seen while fighting the
    tribesmen, founded a breeding farm after the war and renamed the horses,
    "Akhal-Tekes", after the Teke Turkmen tribe that lived around the Akhal oasis
    (near Geok Tepe). The Russians closed the studbook in 1932 which included 287-
    stallions and 468 mares. Stallions are not gelded in Central Asia. The studbook
    was printed in 1941.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Akhal-Teke has had influence on many breeds, possibly including the
    Thoroughbred; the Byerly Turk, which may have been Akhal-Teke, an Arabian, or
    a Turkoman Horse), was one of the three major foundation stallions of the
    breed. Three other stallions thought to be of Turkoman origin, known as the
    "Lister Turk", the "White Turk", and the "Yellow Turk" were among a number of
    minor stallions from the orient who contributed to the foundation bloodstock
    of the Thoroughbred breed. The Trakehner has also been influenced by the
    Akhal-Teke, most notably by the stallion, Turkmen-Atti, as have the Russian
    breeds Don, Budyonny, Karabair, and Karabakh.
  </p>
  <p>
    The breed suffered greatly when the Soviet Union required horses to be
    slaughtered for meat, even though local Turkmen refused to eat them. At one
    point only 1,250 horses remained and export from the Soviet Union was banned.
    The government of Turkmenistan now uses the horses as diplomatic presents as
    well as auctioning a few to raise money for improved horse breeding programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the early twentieth century, crossbreeding between the Thoroughbred and
    the Akhal-Teke took place, aiming to create a faster long-distance racehorse.
    The Anglo Akhal-Tekes were not so resilient however, as their Akhal-Teke
    ancestors, and many died due to the harsh conditions of Central Asia. After
    the 2,600 mile endurance race from Ashkabad to Moscow in 1935, when the
    purebreds finished in much better condition than the part-breds, the studbook
    management decided to consider all crossbred horses born after 1936, as not
    purebred. Horses with English Thoroughbred ancestors born prior to that date
    were allowed to remain inside the studbook (e.g. 044 Tillyakush, grandson of
    Thoroughbred Burlak, 831 Makh, granddaughter of Thoroughbred Blondelli and
    great-great-granddaughter of Thoroughbred Junak, and line founder 9 Ak Belek,
    a direct descendent in the male line of the Thoroughbred stallion Fortingbrass).
    Due to this fact there doesn't exist any Akhal-Teke today whose ancestry
    doesn't contain a Thoroughbred. Since 1973, all foals must be blood typed to
    be accepted in the stud book in order to protect the integrity of the breed.
    From 2014 on, a DNA test based on hair follicles is sufficient if the DNA of
    the parents is on file. A stallion not producing the right type of horse may
    be removed. Nowadays, artificial insemination is allowed as well as embryo
    transfer. The surrogate mother, however, needs to be a pureblood Akhal-Teke
    mare for the foal to be registered in the General Studbook as a pureblood
    Akhal-Teke.
