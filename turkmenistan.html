  <h1>Turkmenistan</h1>
  <p>
    Turkmenistan has a separate agency, Turkmen Atlary, responsible for the breeding,
    training and maintenance of Akhal-Teke horses. However, the agency's work has
    been the focus of criticism from the President of the country, who holds the
    agency responsible for decreasing numbers of horses and inadequate facilities for
    their breeding, training and management. At present Akhal-Teke horses in
    Turkmenistan are not registered with any other studbook. The main reason for
    this are allegations of a heavy infusion of Thoroughbred blood into the breed to
    create faster horses for racing in Turkmenistan. There are estimates that as
    many as 30% of the horses in the Ashgabat hippodrome were not purebred.

    When the first horse minister of newly-independent Turkmenistan, Geldy Kyarizov,
    a lifelong advocate for the Akhal-Teke and former chair of the International
    Association of Akhal-Teke Breeders, began utilizing DNA to establish an Akhal-Teke
    studbook, he uncovered the pattern of adding in Thoroughbred blood. His decision
    to go public with this information was viewed as a threat to the profits of the
    horse-breeding establishment and he fell out of favor with the Turkmenistan
    government, and in particular, then-President Saparmurat Niyazov. He was charged
    with abuse of office and negligence in 2002, convicted and sentenced to six years
    in prison. He was ultimately pardoned in October 2007, when Niyazov died and his
    successor, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, took control of the country. By 2012,
    Kyarizov's health, which had been poor since his arrest and subsequent
    imprisonment, had deteriorated to the point he needed to go abroad for medical
    care, but was initially prevented from leaving the country. By 2015, he was
    allowed to travel to Moscow for medical care, but family members, including
    his 14-year-old daughter, were forced to remain behind to "guarantee" his return.
    Ultimately, in September, 2015, the entire family was allowed to leave.

    Turkmen Atlary, in its capacity as the administrative arm of the International
    Akhal-Teke Horse Association, hosts a meeting of the association once or twice
    a year upon invitation in Ashgabat. Most of the bigger breeding farms and
    national Akhal Teke associations as well as Akhal Teke owners and representatives
    of the horse industry from around the world attend. There is a horse racing
    organization called "Galkinysh". In Ashgabat, the Ahalteke equestrian complex,
    one of the largest in Central Asia, is a horse-breeding center. The former
    Akhal-Teke horse Holiday, celebrated on the last Sunday in April, has been
    renamed 'Turkmen Horse Day'.
